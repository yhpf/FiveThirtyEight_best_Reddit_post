### The Data

I acquired the data by scraping the 'hot' threads as listed on the [Reddit homepage](https://www.reddit.com/).
I scraped 4 pieces of information about each thread:
1. The title of the thread
2. The subreddit that the thread corresponds to
3. The length of time it has been up on Reddit
4. The number of comments on the thread
